    <h3>Abstract</h3>    
    <p>Identifying conditions behind health disparities can guide policy, planning, and financing to battle the most urgent health problems. This study examined the impact of 145 causes of death on life expectancy disparities, highlighting the impact of two sets of “priority conditions”—eight infectious and maternal and child health conditions (“I-8”) and seven noncommunicable diseases and injuries (“NCD-7”)—across 184 countries and nine geographic regions, 2000–2021. Western Europe and Canada (the “North Atlantic”) were used as a benchmark for life expectancy achievable with advanced health care and living standards. Life expectancy gaps were decomposed by cause of death using Pollard’s decomposition on the Global Health Estimates from the World Health Organization. The priority conditions accounted for over 70% of the life expectancy gap compared to the North Atlantic in most regions and countries. Outside sub-Saharan Africa, the NCD-7 accounted for the largest share (eg, 82% in China and 49% in India). Only a few conditions not considered priority conditions had any substantial impact, and only in specific contexts. However, COVID-19 increased disparities. The varying impact of specific priority conditions can help focus health policy and guide interventions to reduce risk factors and treat conditions.</p>

<h2>• Probability of death before age 70: progress as years behind or ahead of the global average trend</h2>

    <h3>Abstract</h3>    
    <p>Advances in health technology and living standards have reduced mortality worldwide but geographic disparities remain. This study examined uneven decline in probability of premature death (PPD)—before age 70 years—across regions, benchmarking progress as years behind or ahead of 1) global average PPD and 2) expected PPD given level of economic development, and 3) years behind PPD in the best performing country each year—the frontier. Global PPD fell from 67% to 32% 1950–2019. Sub-Saharan Africa, Central Asia, and India were behind the global PPD, both in 2000 and 2019. Sub-Saharan Africa’s PPD in 2019 was 52%, corresponding to the 1975 global PPD, suggesting that sub-Saharan Africa had a combination of health-enhancing technologies and living standards observed for the world average 44 years earlier. Sub-Saharan Africa was 100 years behind the frontier PPD, suggesting its 2019 PPD was already achievable in 1919 among those with access to the best available health-enhancing technology and living standards. India converged somewhat towards the global PPD, being 20 years behind in 2000 and 13 years behind in 2019. The North Atlantic was the furthest ahead, 44 years, achieving the 2019 global PPD in 1975. Given GDP, in 2019, the United States had a PPD expected in 1974, which suggests that per capita GDP reflected health-enhancing technologies and living standards to the same extent as in the average country 45 years earlier. International cooperation should ensure that technological and medical advancements lead to universal health benefits that are rapidly and fairly disseminated.</p>
