<h1>ABSTRACT</h1>


<p>Advances in health technology and living standards have reduced
mortality worldwide but geographic disparities remain. This study
examined uneven decline in probability of premature death (PPD)—before
age 70 years—across regions, benchmarking progress as years behind or
ahead of 1) global average PPD and 2) expected PPD given level of
economic development, and 3) years behind PPD in the best performing
country each year—the frontier. Global PPD fell from 67% to 32%
1950–2019. Sub-Saharan Africa, Central Asia, and India were behind the
global PPD, both in 2000 and 2019. Sub-Saharan Africa’s PPD in 2019 was
52%, corresponding to the 1975 global PPD, suggesting that sub-Saharan
Africa had a combination of health-enhancing technologies and living
standards observed for the world average 44 years earlier. Sub-Saharan
Africa was 100 years behind the frontier PPD, suggesting its 2019 PPD
was already achievable in 1919 among those with access to the best
available health-enhancing technology and living standards. India
converged somewhat towards the global PPD, being 20 years behind in 2000
and 13 years behind in 2019. The North Atlantic was the furthest ahead,
44 years, achieving the 2019 global PPD in 1975. Given GDP, in 2019, the
United States had a PPD expected in 1974, which suggests that per capita
GDP reflected health-enhancing technologies and living standards to the
same extent as in the average country 45 years earlier. International
cooperation should ensure that technological and medical advancements
lead to universal health benefits that are rapidly and fairly
disseminated.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>


<p>Life expectancy has been on an upward trajectory for over two
centuries, thanks to advances in medical science, public health, and
living standards.<sup>1,2</sup> However, progress has been uneven across
regions leading to stark disparities in mortality. For example, in 2019,
the probability of premature death (PPD)—the chance of dying before age
70 years—was 15% in Western Europe and Canada, 22% in the United States,
36% in India, and 52% in sub-Saharan Africa.<sup>3</sup></p>


<p>Development is by its nature a long-run process and gaps in important
outcomes such as PPD across countries highlight unequal improvements of
living standards and access to life-extending health
technologies.<sup>4–6</sup> This study examined the uneven decline in
the PPD across geographic regions. Our comparative analysis shows how
many years behind or ahead of global PPD a region was in 2000 and 2019.
For instance, if a region had a PPD in 2019 that was the same as the
global PPD in 1999, we considered that region to be 20 years behind the
global progress in PPD. Conversely, if a region had a PPD in 1999 that
was equivalent to the global PPD of 2019, it was considered 20 years
ahead. We show results for both 2000 and 2019 to explore whether regions
are converging in terms of PPD: that is, whether regions that were
behind in 2000 have been catching up and were fewer years behind in
2019. We also show years behind the “frontier” PPD—PPD in the country
with the lowest PPD each year.</p>


<p>Economic growth and life expectancy improvements are both part of a
broader development process with many shared explanatory factors. Causal
links between economic growth and health have also been suggested,
running in both directions: Improved health can increase growth, since
healthier populations are more productive and have greater incentives to
both save and invest in their human capital (as they expect to live
longer).<sup>2,7</sup> Economic growth can also improve health, for
example, by improving living standards, allowing building and
maintenance of important public health infrastructure, and increasing
spending on medical treatments.<sup>2</sup> Therefore, we also assessed
the PPD performance relative to the expected level of progress given
economic development. We did this by integrating Preston curves—which
show the cross-sectional relationship between PPD and aggregate
income<sup>8</sup>—into our examination. Ultimately, health enhancing
activities will be bounded by income, but countries at the same level of
economic development can still achieve vastly different health outcomes
due to contextual factors, such as prioritization of health spending,
sub-national inequalities, and cultural and environmental factors.</p>


<h1>Data and Methods</h1>


<h2>Data sources</h2>


<p>Mortality probabilities for single year age intervals were obtained
for 236 countries and territories between 1950–2023 from the United
Nations World Population Prospects (UN WPP) 2024 life
tables.<sup>9</sup> These mortality probabilities were used to calculate
the probability of dying before age 70 years
(<em><sub>70</sub>q<sub>0</sub></em>), or PPD. We obtained real per
capita GDP (in 2011 international $) and total population, available for
169 countries from the 2023 version of the Maddison Project
database.<sup>11</sup></p>


<p>We follow the regional classification used in the third report of
<em>The Lancet</em> Commission on Investing in Health: Central Asia,
Central &amp; Eastern Europe, Middle East &amp; North Africa,
sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America &amp; the Caribbean, Western Pacific
&amp; Southeast Asia (excluding China) and the North Atlantic (Western
Europe and Canada: see appendix table S1 for details). We also
considered the three most populous countries separately: China, India,
and the United States (for consciousness, we will refer to these
countries as regions in the text). We also show results for the 30 most
populous countries in 2019 based on UN WPP 2024 population
estimates.<sup>10</sup></p>

<p class="tabFigNote">Notes: Probability of premature death (PPD) was defined as dying
before age 70 years. The line shows Global PPD each year while the
markers indicate PPD in 2019 for each location. The lowest global PPD
ever observed is shown (ie, increases across years were removed).
Regions with lower PPD than the global average are not shown. Data
source: UN WPP 2024.</p>


<h2>Estimating years behind or ahead of the global average PPD</h2>


<p>We restricted our main analyses to years before 2020 to avoid
(presumably) temporary distortions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our
main benchmark was the global PPD from 1950–2019. Since the life
extending technologies generally only advance, we considered increases
in PPD across years in this period to be temporary setbacks. Therefore,
we removed increases in global PPD across years (which happened in 1959,
1960, and 1965): therefore, the benchmark is the lowest global average
PPD ever observed for each year.</p>


<p>We determined how many years behind or ahead a region was compared
with the global PPD. As an example, consider India in 2019. Since India
had a PPD above the global PPD it was behind the global PPD benchmark
(table S2). We then identified the most recent year that the global PPD
was greater than India’s 2019 PPD. That year was 2006 (figure 1).
Therefore, in 2019, India was 13 years behind the global PPD. On the
other hand, China was ahead of the benchmark since it had a PPD below
the global PPD in 2019. We identified the most recent year that China’s
PPD was above the global 2019 PPD. That year was 1997, so, in 2019,
China was 22 years ahead of the global PPD. We do the same for each
region in 2000, which shows whether regions and countries that were
behind are catching up.</p>


<p>As a supplementary analysis, we compare years behind global average
PPD in 2019 to that of 2023 to assess the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic and show results separated for males and females (where
separate benchmarks are used for males and females).</p>


<h2>Years behind the frontier PPD</h2>


<p>We also used the frontier PPD as a benchmark, instead of the global
PPD. The frontier PPD was defined as the country with the lowest PPD
within each year (excluding countries with a population below 3 million
in 2019). Since the earliest PPD observed was 1950, and some regions
were further behind the frontier PPD than 1950, we supplemented the UN
WPP data with data from the Human Mortality Database (HMD),<sup>14</sup>
which provides age-specific mortality probabilities extending back to
l751. The early HMD estimates were only available for a few countries:
however, these now-high-income countries (eg, Sweden, Norway, France),
were likely to be (or at least close to being) the global frontier
before 1950. We removed increases in frontier PPD between years:
therefore, the interpretation of the frontier is the lowest PPD
demonstrated to be possible with the best living standards and most
advanced technology available each year.</p>


<h2>Estimating years behind or ahead of Preston curves</h2>


<p>The Preston curve is a seminal concept relating life expectancy to
per capita aggregate income.<sup>8</sup> With technological
advancements, the Preston curve is expected to shift upwards across
time, such that the same levels of income would result in better life
expectancy in more recent years.<sup>12,13</sup></p>


<p>For this analysis, we first estimated Preston curves for each year
1950–2019 to use as benchmarks. Pooling all years and the 169 countries
with available GDP data (see table S1), we estimated a linear regression
of PPD on (log) real per capita GDP and separate intercepts for each
year (table S3 and figures S1–S3). Technological advancements result in
the intercepts shifting downward, such that in more recent years, lower
PPD should be achieved for the same level of GDP. This shift in the
Preston curve across time allows us to estimate how far behind or ahead
regions were from the 2000 and 2019 Preston curves given their GDP and
PPD. (We observed a few cases where the intercepts moved slightly upward
across years, and adjusted these such that the intercept each year was
the lowest ever observed since 1950.)</p>


<p>First, we determined whether the PPD observed in a region in 2019 was
higher or lower than the PPD predicted by that region’s 2019 per capita
GDP. In other words, we determined whether a region was above (behind)
or below (ahead) the 2019 Preston curve. The region was behind the
Preston curve in 2019 if its observed PPD was greater than the PPD
predicted from the Preston curve, meaning that the region had a higher
PPD than expected given its level of income. Then, we identified the
most recent Preston curve where the target region’s 2019 per capita GDP
predicted a greater PPD than was observed in that region in 2019.
Conversely, the region was ahead of the Preston curve in 2019 if its
observed PPD was lower than the PPD predicted from the 2019 Preston
curve. Then, we identified the most recent Preston curve where the
target region’s 2019 per capita GDP predicted a PPD lower than that
observed in that region in 2019.</p>


<p>As a sensitivity analysis, we moved away from Preston curves when
estimating years behind relative to per capita GDP, and allowed for a
more flexible relationship between per capita GDP and PPD. We regressed
PPD on an intercept and log of per capita GDP for each year separately,
obtaining year-specific intercepts and year-specific GDP slopes (table
S3 and figures S1). Using this specification, the predicted PPD across
the distribution of per capita GDP could intersect between different
years, which goes against what would be suggested by the Preston curve
(the same level of per capita GDP would generally not predict a lower
PPD in an earlier year than a later year; in other words, the amount of
health for a given per capita GDP should increase across years). Using
this more flexible equation, we determined years behind or ahead for a
given level of GDP the same as when using the Preston curves (referring
to the most recent year a lower PPD was observed for a given GDP).</p>


<p>All analyses were conducted using Stata 16 (Stata Corp).</p>


<h1>Results</h1>


<h2>Years behind or ahead of the global average PPD</h2>


<p>The global PPD fell from 67% in 1950 to 32% in 2019 (figure 1). Three
regions had a PPD behind the global PPD in 2019: sub-Saharan Africa,
Central Asia, and India. For example, India’s PPD was 36.9% in 2019: the
most recent year the global PPD was greater than 36.9% was 2006 (when it
was 37.2%, falling to 36.7% in 2007). The last year that the global PPD
was as low as in sub-Saharan Africa in 2019 was 1975, when it was 52%.
Central Asia had a PPD of 40% in 2019, which was last observed for the
global PPD in 2000. This means that sub-Saharan Africa was 44 years
behind the global PPD in 2019, while Central Asia was 19 years behind
and India 13 years behind (figure 2). In 2000, sub-Saharan Africa was
further behind the global PPD, or 48 years behind. India’s relative
gains were larger, having been 20 years behind in 2000.</p>

<p class="tabFigNote">Notes: Probability of premature death (PPD) was defined as dying

<p>Other regions were ahead of the global average PPD. For example,
China had a PPD of 21% in 2019. The last year China had a PPD above the
2019 global PPD (32%) was in 1997, when it was 32.5% (falling to 31.9%
in 1998), putting China 22 years ahead of the global PPD. China made
gains in PPD relative to the global PPD, having been 13 years ahead in
2000. The North Atlantic was the furthest ahead of the global PPD both
in 2000 and 2019, or 49 and 44 years ahead, respectively. The United
States was 43 years ahead of the global PPD in 2000 and 39 years ahead
in 2019. Central &amp; Eastern Europe went from being 9 years behind in
2000 to three years ahead of the global PPD in 2019.</p>


<p>Among the 30 largest countries, Japan and Spain were furthest ahead
of the global PPD in 2019, by 49 years and 48 years, respectively,
followed by Italy at 47 years and France at 44 years ahead. Nigeria was
the furthest behind, 65 years, followed by Kenya, 48 years behind, and
the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Congo DR), 43 years (figure
S4).</p>


<p>The North Atlantic was closest to the frontier PPD, having a PPD of
15%, last observed in the frontier in 2003 (figure 3). Sub-Saharan
Africa was the furthest behind the frontier, with a PPD of 52% in 2019,
last observed in the frontier in 1919.</p>


<h2>Changes 2019–2023 and sex-differences</h2>


<p>Regions that were the furthest ahead of the global average PPD in
2019, the North Atlantic, United States, and China, moved further ahead
in 2023 (figure S5). Regions that less far ahead regressed closer to the
global average PPD 2019–2023: Central &amp; Eastern Europe (which was
below the global average PPD in 2023), Western Pacific &amp; Southeast
Asia, and especially Latin America &amp; the Caribbean and the Middle
East &amp; North Africa. Regions below the global average PPD in
2019—India, Central Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa—remained similarly
positioned relative to the global average PPD in 2019 and 2023. Among
the 30 most populous countries, those ahead of the global PPD in 2019
were further ahead in 2023 and those behind in 2019 were further behind
in 2023 (figures S6).</p>


<p>Among the 10 regions highlighted, sex differences were particularly
large in Central &amp; Eastern Europe, where males were 14 years behind
in 2019 while females were 13 years ahead (figures S7). In 2019, females
were 13 years further ahead than men in the United States, 12 in the
North Atlantic, five in Latin America &amp; the Caribbean, four in
Western Asia &amp; Pacific, two in China, and one in the Middle East
&amp; North Africa. Meanwhile, males were five years further behind than
women in Central Asia, and females were six years further behind than
males in India and four years in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>


<h2>Behind or ahead of the Preston curve</h2>


<p>The United States, Central &amp; Eastern Europe, sub-Saharan Africa,
Central Asia, and India were all above the 2019 Preston curve (figure
4). That is, they had a greater PPD than predicted by their GDP. For
example, in 2019, India had a per capita GDP of around $7300 and a PPD
of 37% (table S2). Meanwhile, the 2019 Preston curve predicted a PPD of
36% for a $7300 per capita GDP: therefore, India was behind (or above)
the Preston curve in 2019. The most recent Preston curve to predict a
PPD below 37% for a per capita GDP of $7300 was in 2000, putting India
19 years behind the 2019 Preston curve (figures S2–S3). The United
States was the furthest behind considering its per capita GDP, being on
the 1974 Preston curve in 2019. Meanwhile, Central &amp; Eastern Europe
was on the 1976 Preston curve, sub-Saharan Africa on the 1982 curve,
Central Asia on the 1997 curve.</p>


<p>The United States had the largest shift backward, being 27 years
behind the expected PPD given its GDP in 2000 and 45 years behind in
2019 (figure 5). Central &amp; Eastern Europe also moved backward, from
being 29 years behind in 2000 to being 43 years behind the Preston curve
in 2019. Central Asia also had a large backward slide, from being 12
years behind in 2000 to 22 years behind in 2019. Sub-Saharan Africa
witnessed a small improvement, being 39 years behind in 2000 and 37 in
2019.</p>

<p>Other regions were ahead of the Preston curve. For example, in 2019,
China had a per capita GDP of almost $17 000 and a PPD of 21% (table
S2). The 2019 Preston curve predicted a PPD of 27% for $17 000 per
capita GDP. The most recent year a GDP of $17 000 predicted a PPD above
21% was 2006, putting China 13 years ahead of the Preston curve in 2019.
The North Atlantic was 1 year ahead of the Preston curve in 2000 and 12
years ahead in 2019.</p>


<p>Nigeria and South Africa were further behind the Preston curve than
1950, meaning the years behind could not be calculated (figure S8).
Otherwise, Russia, Kenya, and the United States were the furthest behind
the Preston curve in 2019, while Vietnam, Japan, Spain, and Italy were
the furthest ahead.</p>


<p>Using a more flexible specification when predicting PPD for a given
GDP shows largely similar results as using Preston curves with fixed
slopes and non-decreasing intercepts across years (figure S9). The
largest absolute difference between the two model specifications, among
the 10 main regions studied was for the United States, which was eight
fewer years behind, and slightly less behind than sub-Saharan
Africa.</p>


<h1>Discussion</h1>


<p>The global average PPD fell from 67% in 1950 to 32% in 2019. However,
the progress has been uneven, with sub-Saharan Africa, Central Asia, and
India lagging. Sub-Saharan Africa and India converged somewhat towards
the global PPD between 2000 and 2019. However, our supplementary
analysis revealed that between 2019 and 2023, during the emergency phase
of the COVID-19 pandemic, a small divergence occurred, where countries
that were ahead moved further ahead and those behind moved further
behind, among the 30 most populous countries. When considering the PPD
expected for a given per capita GDP using Preston curves, sub-Saharan
Africa, Central &amp; Eastern Europe, and the United States were
furthest behind (above) the 2019 PPD Preston curve.</p>


<p>Together these results highlight an uneven process of mortality
improvements across regions, both overall and when considering the
mortality expected for a given level of economic development. In 2019,
sub-Saharan Africa, for example, had a combination of health enhancing
technologies and living standards last observed for the world average in
1975. If considering the best PPD ever observed each year (the frontier
PPD) instead of global PPD, sub-Saharan Africa could be considered
hundred years behind the PPD possible if given the best available health
enhancing technology and living standard. The relative lag in the
mortality decline observed in sub-Saharan Africa, Central Asia, and
India may reflect a wide range of factors, such as difficulties in
implementing and accessing health enhancing innovation, low living
standards, and unique challenges related to these contexts.</p>


<p>Despite enormous improvements, sub-Saharan Africa continues to have
high mortality from infectious diseases and neonatal and maternal
conditions, due to a lack of basic healthcare and public services for
much of the population.<sup>15</sup> Although infectious diseases and
neonatal conditions continue to play a sizable role in premature
mortality in Central Asia and India, non-communicable diseases are
increasingly driving premature mortality differentials, suggesting a
need for control of risk factors, particularly to tackle early deaths
from cardiovascular disease (eg, smoking, hypertension, high
cholesterol).<sup>16</sup></p>


<p>Early advances in agricultural technology improved
nutrition<sup>17</sup> and discovery of the germ theory of diseases
eventually led to improvements in sanitation, hygiene, and food
standards, causing early declines in mortality and increased life
expectancy in today’s rich countries in the 19<sup>th</sup> and early
20<sup>th</sup> century.<sup>18,19</sup> Implementing these early
technological innovations required public action and major investments
into large scale projects. Health improvements were, therefore, somewhat
more contingent on economic growth. Over time these costs go down. Also,
in the later 20<sup>th</sup> century, health enhancing innovations were
to a larger extent individually targeted medical interventions. For
example, vaccines, oral rehydration therapy, and statins can have large
health benefits at a low cost, enabling countries to achieve better
health at a lower level economic development than before.<sup>20</sup>
Therefore, the Preston curve has shifted, such that the same level of
per capita GDP affords better health today than in the past.</p>


<p>The structural, historical, and sociopolitical context of each region
plays a crucial role in shaping health outcomes at any level of economic
development. Incomes may be unequally distributed, not spent on health,
or even achieved through means that are detrimental to health.
Conversely, countries can also make use of resources efficiently,
prioritize health, implement cost-effective interventions, or practice
healthy behaviors (eg, healthier diet and alcohol restrictions) and
thereby achieve low mortality at low level of GDP.<sup>21,22</sup>
However, ultimately, aggregate income constrains living standards and
the ability to implement effective health interventions—such as
healthcare, public safety, and establishment and maintenance of water,
sanitation, and other important infrastructure. Taking these economic
constraints into account suggests that China manages to ensure high
level of health for its level of economic development. Conversely, the
results suggest that the United States, Central &amp; Eastern Europe,
sub-Saharan Africa, and Central Asia were behind the PPD expected given
their level of aggregate income. The reasons why economic development
does not translate into low mortality are likely to vary across these
regions.</p>


<p>In the United States, for example, per capita GDP translates into
health enhancing technologies and living standards to the same extent as
in the average country 45 years earlier. Despite a high per capita GDP
(and the highest global health care spending<sup>23</sup>), the Unites
States has high levels of economic inequality.<sup>24</sup> The
individual income-health relationship tends to show diminishing marginal
returns in health to increased income: therefore, greater inequality at
the same level of aggregate income will inevitably lead to higher
observed mortality.<sup>25–27</sup> Further, the healthcare systems in
the United States suffers from spending waste<sup>28</sup> and gun
violence (homicide and suicide) and road traffic deaths cause an
unusually high loss of life for a rich country.<sup>15</sup> Finally,
the United States is going through a substance use epidemic, which has
been claiming an increasing number of lives, especially since
2014.<sup>29</sup> In fact, despite continued economic growth, life
expectancy in the United States has been declining.<sup>30,31</sup></p>


<p>Central &amp; Eastern Europe has witnessed rapid economic growth,
especially since 1990, but continues to have a large number of deaths
due to alcohol misuse and suicide, especially among
males.<sup>15,32</sup> The prominence of the mining sector in
sub-Saharan Africa and “the resource curse”—suggested to reduce human
development by decreasing equality,<sup>33</sup> quality of
institutions,<sup>34</sup> and public spending<sup>35</sup>—may to an
extent explain why it remains far behind of the Preston
curve.<sup>36</sup></p>


<p>Our study has five key limitations. First, our conclusions rely on
the quality and availability of mortality and economic data across
regions. We relied on estimates from the UN WPP 2024 for the main
analysis, which are widely used and generally considered reliable.
Second, comparing regions based on years behind or ahead of global PPD
progress simplifies complex temporal dynamics and regional disparities.
Third, the links between per capita GDP and PPD estimated in our paper
were not causal in either direction. However, our goal was to describe
expected PPD for a given level of economic development, which does not
imply causality. Fifth, the analyses were purely descriptive and do not
provide explanations for the differences observed.</p>


<h1>Conclusions</h1>


<p>In the context of long run and largely uninterrupted declines in
premature mortality, our comparative analytic approach illuminates
uneven progress across regions. By comparing mortality disparities as
years behind or ahead of the global curve, this study highlights the
temporal nature of mortality declines across the world.</p>
