<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>Identifying conditions behind health disparities can guide policy,
planning, and financing to battle the most urgent health problems. This
study examined the impact of 145 causes of death on life expectancy
disparities, highlighting the impact of two sets of “priority
conditions”—eight infectious and maternal and child health conditions
(“I-8”) and seven noncommunicable diseases and injuries (“NCD-7”)—across
184 countries and nine geographic regions, 2000–2021. Western Europe and
Canada (the “North Atlantic”) were used as a benchmark for life
expectancy achievable with advanced health care and living standards.
Life expectancy gaps were decomposed by cause of death using Pollard’s
decomposition on the Global Health Estimates from the World Health
Organization. The priority conditions accounted for over 70% of the life
expectancy gap compared to the North Atlantic in most regions and
countries. Outside sub-Saharan Africa, the NCD-7 accounted for the
largest share (eg, 82% in China and 49% in India). Only a few conditions
not considered priority conditions had any substantial impact, and only
in specific contexts. However, COVID-19 increased disparities. The
varying impact of specific priority conditions can help focus health
policy and guide interventions to reduce risk factors and treat
conditions.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Advances in public health and medicine, together with rising living
standards, have greatly improved health, as reflected, for example, in
largely uninterrupted gains in life expectancy over the past two
centuries.<sup>1,2</sup> However, large health disparities suggest
highly uneven improvements across countries. For example, while life
expectancy at birth is 82 years in Western Europe, it is 62 years in
sub-Saharan Africa.<sup>3</sup> Limited capacity to finance and mobilize
resources leaves full coverage of vital services out of reach for many
countries.<sup>4</sup> A focus on a limited number of highly
cost-effective interventions targeted at conditions with a large or
rising impact on health is more feasible.<sup>5–8</sup></p>


<p>Here, we quantified how much 145 causes of death available in the
Global Health Estimates (GHE) from the World Health Organization (WHO)
contributed to the life expectancy gap in global regions and countries
compared to the North Atlantic (Western Europe and Canada)—which serves
as a benchmark for a life expectancy that is achievable with high living
standards and advanced health care. We highlight the impact of two sets
of causes which are suggested “priority conditions” by the third
<em>Lancet</em> Commission on Investing in Health:<sup>9</sup> 1) eight
infectious and maternal and child health conditions and 2) seven
important noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and injuries.</p>


<p>Life expectancy serves as a reliable summary health indicator that
reflects the composite impact of most adverse health exposures and
morbidities on population health, including both acute exposures, such
as deadly infections and injuries, and an accumulation of adverse
exposures over the life course, such as nutrition, environmental
contaminants, morbidities, and health behaviors.<sup>10</sup></p>


<h1>Data and methods</h1>


<h2>Data</h2>


<p>Data on number of deaths by cause came from the WHO’s GHE (see
appendix pp 2–3 for more details).<sup>11,12</sup> Deaths were reported
by age and sex for 204 countries over the period 2000–2021. Five-year
age groups were used for ages 5–84, with an open-ended group for 85 and
older. Deaths before age five were estimated for two age groups: 0–11
months and 1–4 years.</p>


<p>We multiply the proportion of all deaths from each cause within each
age interval from the WHO GHE by the corresponding all-cause
age-specific mortality rate from the United Nations (UN) World
Population Prospects (WPP) 2024.<sup>3</sup> Therefore, the life
expectancy and gaps presented in this paper will be the same as those
provided by the UN. We used life tables with single year age intervals
for ages 0–100+ from the UN WPP and estimated the causes specific
mortality rates using the same cause-proportions for all single-year
ages within the broader WHO GHE age intervals.</p>


<p>The first eight priority conditions include a set of infectious
diseases, maternal deaths, and conditions causing the most child deaths
(collectively referred to as the I-8).<sup>5</sup> These were:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>

<p>Neonatal conditions</p></li>
<li>

<p>Lower respiratory infections</p></li>
<li>

<p>Diarrheal diseases</p></li>
<li>

<p>HIV/AIDS</p></li>
<li>

<p>Tuberculosis</p></li>
<li>

<p>Malaria</p></li>
<li>

<p>Childhood-cluster diseases: Whooping cough, Diphtheria, Measles,
Tetanus</p></li>
<li>

<p>Maternal conditions</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Seven NCDs and injuries (NCD-7) were also highlighted as priority
conditions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>

<p>Atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ischemic heart disease,
ischemic stroke)</p></li>
<li>

<p>Hemorrhagic stroke</p></li>
<li>

<p>NCDs strongly linked to infections (stomach cancer, liver cancer
secondary to hepatitis B, liver cancer secondary to hepatitis C,
cervical cancer, rheumatic heart disease, cirrhosis due to hepatitis B,
cirrhosis due to hepatitis C)</p></li>
<li>

<p>NCDs strongly linked to tobacco use (mouth and oropharynx cancer;
trachea, bronchus, and lung cancer; larynx cancer; chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease)</p></li>
<li>

<p>Diabetes (diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease due to
diabetes)</p></li>
<li>

<p>Road injury</p></li>
<li>

<p>Suicide (self-harm)</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Collectively, these 15 priority conditions reflect 30 causes of death
as defined in the WHO GHE data (items in parentheses above: see table on
page 3 in the appendix). The other 115 causes of death are referred to
as “all other causes.”</p>


<h1>Methods</h1>


<p>We used regional classifications from the third <em>Lancet</em>
Commission on Investing in Health, consisting of seven geographic
regions and the three most populous countries, China, India, and the
United States (appendix p 4). We focus on 2019 to avoid distortions due
to COVID-19 and show results for 2000 for comparison across time.
(Supplement 2 provides results for all countries 2000–2021 by sex and
overall.)</p>


<p>We decomposed the difference in life expectancy between the North
Atlantic and target locations (ie, other regions and countries of
interest) into components (in terms of years) attributable to the 145
causes of death. The North Atlantic in 2019 was used, even when
analyzing other years in the target locations, to facilitate comparisons
across time. The North Atlantic was chosen since it had the greatest
life expectancy (82 years<sup>3</sup>) of the regions highlighted in the
third <em>Lancet</em> Commission on Investing in Health.</p>


<p>We used Pollard’s decomposition method to quantify the contribution
of each cause to the total life expectancy gap.<sup>13,14</sup> The
formulas described here apply specifically to life tables with a radix
of one and single-year age intervals.</p>


<p><span class="math display">\[C_{i} = \sum_{x = 1}^{100
+}{w_{x}({_{n}^{}m}_{x,i} - {_{n}^{}\ddot{m}}_{x,i})}\]</span></p>


<p>Component <span class="math inline">\(C_{i}\)</span> shows the gap in
life expectancy attributable to cause <em>i</em>, and is calculated as
the difference in the cause-specific mortality rate at age <em>x</em> to
<em>x+n</em> between the target location (<span
class="math inline">\({_{n}^{}m}_{x,i}\)</span>) and the North Atlantic
(<span class="math inline">\({_{n}^{}\ddot{m}}_{x,i}\)</span>),
multiplied by a weight <span class="math inline">\(w_{x}\)</span>
representing the contribution of deaths at age <em>x</em> to the overall
life expectancy gap, summed across all ages 0–100+.</p>


<p>The weight <span class="math inline">\(w_{x}\)</span> is calculated
as:</p>


<p><span class="math display">\[w_{x} = \frac{l_{x}{\ddot{e}}_{x} +
{\ddot{l}}_{x}e_{x} + l_{x + 1}{\ddot{e}}_{x + 1} + {\ddot{l}}_{x +
1}e_{x + 1}}{4}\]</span></p>


<p>where <span class="math inline">\(e_{x}\)</span> is life expectancy
at age <em>x</em> and <span class="math inline">\(l_{x}\)</span> is the
proportion of the original cohort surviving to age <em>x</em> in the
target location, with two dots over a letter indicating the same
measures for the North Atlantic. For age <em>x=100</em>+, the weight is
calculated as:</p>


<p><span class="math display">\[w_{100 +} = \frac{{\ddot{T}}_{100
+}/M_{100 +} + T_{100 +}/{\ddot{M}}_{100 + ,i}}{2}\]</span></p>


<p>where <em>T</em> is the number of years contributed after age
<em>100</em> and <em>M</em> is the all-cause mortality rate at age 100+.
The sum of <span class="math inline">\(C_{i}\)</span> over all causes of
death is the total gap in life expectancy between the target location
and the North Atlantic.</p>


<p>To facilitate the presentation of results, we removed causes that had
a negative impact, which occurred when the target location had achieved
lower cause-specific mortality rates than the North Atlantic. However,
after this adjustment, adding the impact of all causes together could
result in a total impact greater than the actual life expectancy gap.
Therefore, we projected the estimated proportional impact of each cause
(after removing negative impacts) back onto the life expectancy gap.
(Supplement 2 provides results with negative impacts included.)</p>


<h2>Supplementary analyses</h2>


<p>We present summary statistics on the extent to which the priority
conditions accounted for life expectancy disparities across 184
countries with lower life expectancy than the North Atlantic. We also
show results using two alternative decomposition methods:
Arriaga’s<sup>15</sup> method and a method based on counterfactual
age-specific mortality rates<sup>16</sup> (see appendix p 6 for
description of methods). Finally, we provide estimates for all causes,
regions, and countries, 2000–2021, by sex and overall.</p>

<h1>Results</h1>


<h2>Regions and selected countries in 2000 and 2019</h2>


<p>In 2000, sub-Saharan Africa had a 31-year life expectancy gap
compared to the (2019) North Atlantic benchmark (figure 1 and table 1).
Higher mortality from I-8 accounted for 21 of those years (67% of the
total gap). Meanwhile, higher mortality from the NCD-7 accounted for 4.4
years (14%). By 2019, the life expectancy gap for sub-Saharan Africa had
declined to 22 years—11 (50%) of which were attributable to I-8 and 5
(23%) to NCD-7. Central Asia had had a nearly even split between I-8 and
NCD-7, with 8.1 years (39%) of a 21-year gap explained by I-8 and 8.4
(40%) by the NCD-7 in 2000. In 2019, the life expectancy gap there had
declined to 15 years, less of which was explained by I-8 (4.2 years,
29%) and more by the NCD-7 (7.1 years, 48%). In 2000, India had a life
expectancy gap of 20 years, 11 (55%) explained by I-8 and 5.2 (27%)
attributable to mortality from NCD-7. In 2019, the life expectancy gap
in India had declined to 12 years, of which 3.4 (29%) were attributable
to I-8 and 5.6 (49%) to NCD-7.</p>


<p>In Western Pacific &amp; Southeast Asia, 5.3 years (41%) of a 13-year
life expectancy gap were attributable to I-8 and 5 (39%) to NCD-7 in
2000. In 2019, the life expectancy gap was 7.4 years, 2.1 years (28%)
explained by I-8 and 3.7 (50%) by NCD-7. In Latin America &amp; the
Caribbean, the life expectancy gap was 11 years in 2000, 2.5 years (22%)
accounted for by I-8 and 4.8 (42%) by NCD-7. The gap was 7 years in
2019, 1.4 years (20%) due to I-8, and 2.8 (40%) due to NCD-7. In the
Middle East &amp; North Africa, the life expectancy gap was 13 years in
2000, of which 2.6 years (20%) were attributable to I-8 and 7.1 years
(56%) to NCD-7. That gap was 7.6 years in 2019, of which 1 year (13%)
was attributable to I-8 and 4.6 years (60%) to the NCD-7.</p>

<p  class="tabFigNote">Note: Both 2000 and 2019 were compared to the North Atlantic in 2019
(which had a life expectancy of 82 years). The I-8 are neonatal
conditions, lower respiratory infections, diarrheal diseases, HIV/AIDS,
tuberculosis, malaria, childhood-cluster diseases, and maternal
conditions. The NCD-7 are atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases,
hemorrhagic stroke, NCDs strongly linked to infections, NCDs strongly
linked to tobacco use, diabetes, road injury, and suicide. Data from
references 3 and 11.</p>


<p>In Central &amp; Eastern Europe in 2000, I-8 accounted for 0.9 years
(8.2%) of a 14-year gap, while the NCD-7 accounted for 9.2 years (66%).
In 2019, the gap was 7.6 years, of which 0.5 years (7%) were accounted
for by I-8 and 5.2 years (68%) by the NCD-7. In China, the I-8 explained
1.7 years (17%) of a 10-year life expectancy gap in 2000, while the
NCD-7 accounted for 6.3 years (63%). In 2019, the life expectancy gap in
China had declined to 4.3 years, with 0.2 years (4%) attributable to I-8
and 3.5 years (82%) to NCD-7. The United States had a 5.4-year gap in
2000, of which 0.3 years (6%) were explained by I-8 and 3.6 years (66%)
by NCD-7. In 2019, the life expectancy gap was 3.3 years, 0.1 years (3%)
due to I-8, and 1.5 years (44%) due to NCD-7.</p>


<h2>A more detailed look at the causes behind the life expectancy gaps
in 2019</h2>


<p>In sub-Saharan Africa in 2019, where I-8 still explains half the
total life expectancy gap, lower respiratory infections accounted for
the largest share by individual cause (2.1 years, 9.6%; figure 2 and
table 1). Tuberculosis accounted for 2 years (9.2%), HIV/AIDS for 1.6
years (7.5%), neonatal conditions for 1.5 years (7.1%), and diarrheal
diseases for 1.4 years (6.5%). Maternal conditions accounted for 1.2
years (5.4%) for females in sub-Saharan Africa (appendix p 8).</p>


<p>In India in 2019 neonatal conditions and diarrheal diseases accounted
for about 1 year (8%) of the life expectancy gap each. Lower respiratory
infections and tuberculosis account for around 5% each, contributing 0.7
and 0.5 years, respectively. Further, in India in 2019—where the NCD-7
have risen in importance relative to the I-8 since 2000—atherosclerotic
CVDs accounted for the largest share of the life expectancy gap, 2.1
years (18%), followed by tobacco-related NCDs (1.6 years, 14%; figure 3
and table 1). Hemorrhagic stroke, diabetes, and infection-related NCDs
each contributed approximately 0.5 years (5%). In China, atherosclerotic
CVDs explained 1.2 years (27%) of the life expectancy gap. Hemorrhagic
stroke accounted for 0.8 years (19%), tobacco-related NCDs for 0.7 years
(17%), and infection-related NCDs for 0.5 years (11%).</p>


<p>Most I-8 had a reduced impact between 2000 and 2019 (table 1). In
sub-Saharan Africa, the impact of HIV/AIDS, diarrheal diseases, malaria,
tuberculosis, and childhood cluster diseases declined the most. In
India, diarrheal diseases, neonatal conditions, and lower respiratory
infections had the most significant decline in impact.</p>

<p>For NCD-7, the change in impact varied across locations and causes of
death, with the impact of most causes decreasing over time. In general,
there were no substantial increases in the impact of individual NCD-7
conditions in absolute terms, although the impact of atherosclerotic
CVDs and diabetes rose somewhat in a few regions, for example,
sub-Saharan Africa and India. Meanwhile, there were considerable
declines in the impact of atherosclerotic CVDs in Central &amp; Eastern
Europe, Middle East &amp; North Africa, and Latin America &amp; the
Caribbean. China had a substantial decline in the impact of
tobacco-related NCDs, hemorrhagic stroke, and infection-related
NCDs.</p>


<h2>Country-level analysis</h2>


<p>The percentage of life expectancy gap attributable to higher I-8
mortality ranged from 0 to 63% of the total gap across the 184 countries
with lower life expectancy than the North Atlantic (with a median of
16%: figure 4 and appendix p 10 for tabulated estimates). The percentage
share accounted for by higher mortality from the NCD-7 ranged from 13%
to 82% across countries (with a median of 48%). The percentage share
accounted for by both I-8 and NCD-7 combined ranged from 30% to 89%
across countries and was 72% in the median country.</p>


<p>Only in low-income countries was the median percentage share
accounted for by I-8 greater than the NCD-7. There was a large positive
correlation (r = 0.82) between the share accounted for by I-8 and the
total gap in life expectancy across countries (appendix p 11).</p>

strongly linked to tobacco use, diabetes, road injury, and suicide. Data
from references 3 and 11.</p>


<h2><br />
</h2>


<h2>Sex-specific results, alternative decomposition methods, and other
important conditions</h2>


<p>The impact of I-8 was substantially greater for females in India,
primarily due to a larger impact from diarrheal diseases (0.7 years for
males and 1.2 for females) and to a lesser extent due to lower
respiratory infections and neonatal conditions (appendix pp 8 and 12).
Maternal condition also had a notable impact in some regions, such as
sub-Saharan Africa and Central Asia. The impact of NCD-7 was somewhat
greater for females in sub-Saharan Africa (4.8 vs 5.3 years), primarily
due to atherosclerotic CVDs (2.6 vs 3.1) and infection-related NCDs (0.6
vs 1).</p>


<p>Tuberculosis had a greater impact on males in sub-Saharan Africa.
Overall, the life expectancy gap was much greater for males than females
in Central &amp; Eastern Europe (9.9 vs 5.4-year gap), partially due to
atherosclerotic CVDs (4.2 vs 3.4 years) and tobacco-related NCDs (0.6 vs
0 years). Tobacco-related NCDs also had a somewhat bigger impact on
males in Central Asia (1 vs 0.5 years). In addition, there was an impact
of road injuries for males in some regions, for example, sub-Saharan
Africa. Suicide was not a prominent explanatory factor in any region
except somewhat for males in Central &amp; Eastern Europe, 0.4 years
(3.7%), and in the United States, 0.2 years (6%).</p>


<p>The North Atlantic had a 0.5- and 0.2-year decline in life expectancy
between 2019 and 2021, for males and females, respectively (appendix p
13). The gap in life expectancy (compared to the North Atlantic in 2019)
had grown considerably in the United States in 2021, to 6.3 years for
males and 5.1 years for females, with COVID-19 explaining 1.7 years
(27%) and 1.5 years (28%) of the total gap, respectively. Life
expectancy in Latin America &amp; the Caribbean, Central &amp; Eastern
Europe, and India was impacted by COVID-19 to a much greater extent than
in the North Atlantic, increasing the life expectancy gap.</p>


<p>Results were highly similar when using different decomposition
methods (appendix pp 15 and 17).</p>


<p>Here, we note all causes not included in the I-8 or NCD-7 that had an
impact greater than either 0.5 years or 10% of the total gap in life
expectancy in 2019 in the six regions and three countries highlighted.
Interpersonal violence accounted for 1.3 years (17% of the total life
expectancy gap) for males in Latin America &amp; the Caribbean and 0.6
years (3.6%) in sub-Saharan Africa (appendix p 19). (Interpersonal
violence contributed 3 of a 13-year gap for males in El Salvador; the
highest globally: see Supplement 2.) In the United States, drug use
disorders accounted for 0.5 years (15%) for males and “Alzheimer disease
and other dementias” accounted for 0.4 years (12%) for females.
Hypertensive heart disease had an impact of 0.8 years (3.6%) for females
in sub-Saharan Africa and 0.5 years (6.8%) in the Middle East &amp;
North Africa. “Cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, endocarditis” had an impact
of 0.5 years (5.5%) for males in Central &amp; Eastern Europe.</p>


<h1>Discussion</h1>


<p>In the six regions and the three most populous countries highlighted
in this paper, mortality from the priority conditions, the I-8 and
NCD-7, together accounted for almost 80% of the life expectancy
disparity relative to the North Atlantic in most cases. The NCD-7
commonly accounted for over half the total gap in 2019. We observed an
impressive decline in the impact of I-8 in sub-Saharan Africa 2000–2019,
which drove a large overall decline in the life expectancy disparity.
Meanwhile, the impact of NCD-7 rose. Further, India transitioned from
having most of the disparity attributable to deaths from I-8 in 2000 to
having a larger share explained by NCD-7 in 2019. The NCD-7 and I-8
together accounted for over 70% of the life expectancy disparity in most
countries.</p>


<p>Among the 115 causes not among the I-8 and NCD-7, hardly any had a
large impact (or more than 10% or 0.5 years of the total life expectancy
gap), which underscores the importance of relatively few priority
conditions. However, interpersonal violence had a large impact for males
in Latin America &amp; the Caribbean, and drug use disorder had a
considerable impact in the United States. (However, by 2021, the
COVID-19 pandemic had put most regions further behind the North
Atlantic, especially India, Latin America &amp; the Caribbean, and
Central &amp; Eastern Europe.)</p>


<p>Our results highlight the importance of ensuring coverage of the most
essential health interventions aimed at the 15 priority conditions for
improving population health. The WHO suggested that in 2021, 4.5 billion
people were not covered by essential health services<sup>17,18</sup> and
that current health expenditure is far below what is needed to provide
these.<sup>4,19,20</sup> The World Bank estimated that even with
favorable policies and economic growth, the financing gap in low and
middle-income countries would only be reduced by about a third by
2030.<sup>4</sup> In settings with severely constrained finances,
covering a limited number of critical interventions addressing the most
urgent health problems might be more financially and administratively
feasible, without sacrificing population health gains.<sup>5</sup></p>


<p>The priority conditions are prominent or rising health concerns with
known determinants and cost-effective solutions.<sup>5,21</sup> The
relative impact of each cause on life expectancy disparities can guide
policy emphasis, planning, and the allocation of additional health
spending. Of the causes highlighted in this paper, atherosclerotic CVDs
accounted for the largest share of the life expectancy gap in all
regions except sub-Saharan Africa (where it also accounts for a
substantial and increasing share). The importance of atherosclerotic
CVDs highlights the need for improving diagnosis of
hypertension<sup>22</sup> and medical interventions (eg, statins) and
behavioral interventions (eg, reduced smoking, improved diet, and
increased physical activity) to delay mortality from these
causes.<sup>23</sup> Preventative interventions for diabetes, such as
taxation of sugary drinks,<sup>24</sup> and improved diagnosis and
treatment,<sup>25</sup> can be implemented to combat the considerable
and rising relative impact of diabetes in some regions.</p>


<p>The significant effect of tobacco-related NCDs in China and India
suggests that gains can be made through tobacco control, for instance,
by legislation restricting smoking<sup>26</sup> and
taxation.<sup>7</sup> However, in both China and India, smoking is much
more prevalent among males (while both prevalence and sex differences
are smaller in the North Atlantic). Still, the impact of tobacco-related
NCDs was similar for males and females in China and greater for females
in India, which may suggest that other factors, such as
outdoor<sup>27</sup> and indoor<sup>28</sup> air pollution, may play a
role.</p>


<p>An expansion of maternal and child health interventions (especially
prevention of diarrhea, neonatal conditions, and lower respiratory
infections) and tuberculosis interventions remains essential in
sub-Saharan Africa, India, Central Asia, and Western Pacific &amp;
Southeast Asia. Since childhood deaths often result from repeated
adverse exposures, an intervention aimed at reducing deaths from one
condition can also indirectly reduce mortality from other
causes.<sup>29</sup> Poor health in childhood can also have compounding
effects on human development in terms of health,<sup>30,31</sup>
physiological<sup>32</sup> and cognitive development<sup>33</sup> and
schooling and income,<sup>34</sup> which in turn are linked to life
expectancy.<sup>35</sup></p>


<p>Some of the causes highlighted here contributed little to the life
expectancy disparities. The relatively small impact of childhood-cluster
diseases highlights the success of the widespread (although incomplete)
distribution of vaccines.<sup>36,37</sup> For example, in sub-Saharan
Africa, the impact of childhood-cluster diseases was considerable in
2000 (1.5 years) but had declined substantially by 2019 (to 0.4 years).
Further, suicide had little (or, often, no) impact on life expectancy
disparities since suicide is not particularly rare in the North
Atlantic.<sup>38</sup> Suicide is also only the most extreme consequence
of poor mental health, which is a rising health concern, and is
associated with heightened mortality from a range of conditions, likely
stemming from factors such as health behaviors, access to care, and
socioeconomic factors.<sup>39,40</sup></p>


<p>Previous studies have used the measures of amenable mortality—or
deaths that could have been avoided with timely and effective care—to
measure shortcomings in health.<sup>41,42</sup> Amenable mortality
evidences a similar geographic distribution as the life expectancy
disparities in this study and also suggests a greater need for
addressing mortality from infectious diseases and maternal and child
deaths at lower levels of development.<sup>41</sup> This study takes a
more general approach using a more straightforward metric and benchmarks
shortcomings to an outcome that has been achieved. However, studies
using amenable mortality remind us that further improvements can be
achieved even in our benchmark—the North Atlantic—by reducing avoidable
deaths.</p>


<p>Some limitations and caveats should be kept in mind when interpreting
these results. First, there are caveats related to using life expectancy
to identify current shortcomings in health. Mortality often results from
repeated or extended periods of adverse exposures (eg, smoking, diet,
and early life infections and undernutrition) involving many interlinked
factors. Since (period) life expectancy gives a snapshot of current
age-specific mortality, this decomposition will not capture the impact
of recent health interventions and changes in underlying risk factors
that impact mortality rates with delays. For example, rowecent dramatic
declines in tobacco use in India are likely to reduce the impact of
tobacco-related NCDs in the future.<sup>43</sup> Therefore, the results
from this paper should be viewed together with information on recent
changes in underlying risk factors.</p>


<p>Second, there are limitations related to data quality. Data in
countries without well-functioning vital registration systems relied on
censuses, survey data (eg, sibling survival), and model life tables to
estimate all-cause mortality; and various methods and sources for
specific causes of death.<sup>12</sup> However, data quality issues were
unlikely to be an underlying factor in driving the predominant
importance of the priority conditions.</p>


<h1>Conclusions</h1>


<p>This study underscores the significant impact of 15 priority
conditions on life expectancy disparities, with notable regional
variations and transitions over time. The decline in deaths from I-8,
particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, contrasts with the rising importance
of NCD-7, highlighting the evolving nature of global health challenges.
These findings emphasize the critical importance of focusing limited
resources on the key conditions that contribute the most to poor health
and health disparities.</p>
