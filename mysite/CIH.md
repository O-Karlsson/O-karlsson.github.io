"GH2035 provided systematic evidence for the high
value of mortality declines in much of the worldâ€”a value
that was often a substantial fraction of GDP growth. We
have updated those findings up to 2019 and reiterate the
high economic value of actually experienced mortality
declines. Today, the case is better than ever for the value
of investing in health for reducing mortality and
morbidity, alleviating poverty, and improving human
welfare."
